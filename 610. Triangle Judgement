SELECT *, IF(x+y>z and x+z>y and y+z>x, 'Yes','No') AS triangle FROM triangle

#explaination
SELECT *: This selects all columns from the "triangle" table.
IF(x+y>z and x+z>y and y+z>x, 'Yes','No') AS triangle: This part creates a new column named "triangle" in the result. 
It uses the IF function to check if the conditions x+y>z, x+z>y, and y+z>x are all true.
If all these conditions are true, it assigns the value 'Yes' to the "triangle" column; otherwise, it assigns the value 'No'. 
The variables x, y, and z represent the values in the respective columns of each row in the "triangle" table.
FROM triangle: This specifies the table from which the data is being retrieved, in this case, the "triangle" table.
